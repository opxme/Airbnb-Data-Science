<h1>JWipe - Disk Sanitization</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
<b>Project consists of an analysis of a csv file using python. </b> <br/>
The csv file was sourced from inside Airbnb website and it shows information on listings of properties being rented by property owners. <br/>
It contains information such as latitude, longitude, neighbourhood, amenities, capacity, number of bedrooms, number of beds, number of reviews, price per night, availability in the next 3 months etc. <br/>
The scope of the exercise was to determine what relevant data could influence the variation of price and an attempt to predict it.<br/>
The project consists of a user interface that displays a menu with the following options:<br/>
- visual representation through interactive maps that show the location of the listings and statistical data based on the different neighbourhoods. <br/>
- visual representation of the dataset in relation to price: histograms, density plots, heatmaps, barplots, boxplots, scatterplots. <br/>
- price prediction by filtering the dataset <br/>
- price prediction by making a simple linear regression <br/>
<br />
